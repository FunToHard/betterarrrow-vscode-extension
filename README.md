# BetterArrow Extension

## Overview

The BetterArrow extension for VS Code allows you to use `j`, `k`, `l`, and `;` as arrow keys (left, up, down, right) when holding the `Alt` key. This can improve your coding efficiency by keeping your hands on the home row.

## Why BetterArrow?

Using `j`, `k`, `l`, and `;` instead of `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` is easier while holding the `Alt` key. This layout minimizes finger movement and reduces strain, making it more ergonomic and efficient for prolonged coding sessions.

## Features

* `Alt + j` - Move cursor left
* `Alt + k` - Move cursor up
* `Alt + l` - Move cursor down
* `Alt + ;` - Move cursor right

## Installation

1. Open the Extensions view by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X` (or `Cmd+Shift+X` on Mac).
2. Search for "BetterArrow".
3. Click "Install" to install the extension.

## Usage

1. Hold the `Alt` key.
2. Use `j`, `k`, `l`, and `;` to navigate your code.

## Configuration

No additional configuration is required. The extension works out of the box.
